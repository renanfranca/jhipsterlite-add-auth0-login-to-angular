## Node.js and NPM

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).
